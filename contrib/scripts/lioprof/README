1. Introduction to launcher.sh
    This LIOProf logging services script is used to record detailed I/O Tracing
information carried out on Lustre OSS nodes, it requires superuser privilege.

[Input]
(1) Input usage information
    Usage: launcher.sh [-a] [-d] [-l] [-h] [-m] [-n] [-o] [-u]
        -a  command to launch application
        -d  shared nfs directory to store LIOProf logs
        -l  lowest Lustre OSS node [Hostname]
        -h  highest Lustre OSS node [Hostname]
        -m  lowest Lustre Client [Hostname]
        -n  highest Lustre Client [Hostname]
        -o  use Obdfilter-survey to measure Lustre bandwidth
        -u  user name

(2) Input example
    a. Launch application
        # su
        # launcher.sh -l wolf-33 -h wolf-36 -m wolf-38 -n wolf-41 -u USER_NAME \
        # -d /home/USER_NAME/lioprof_home -a "mpirun -np 4 hostname"
    b. Launch Obdfilter-survey to measure Lustre bandwidth
        # su
        # launcher.sh -l wolf-33 -h wolf-36 -u USER_NAME \
        # -d /home/USER_NAME/lioprof_home -o

[Output]
(1) Output location
    All the outputs locate in the directory configured by '-d' argument. In the
above example, logs are stored in /home/USER_NAME/lioprof_home directory.

(2) Application output information
    a. job-output: Output of the job.
    b. brw:  Disk I/O sizes
    c. iostat: Disks bandwidth, CPU utilization
    d. rpc: Lustre rpc tracing information

(3) Obdfilter-survey output information
    a. obdfilter: Lustre OST bandwidth
    *Note: OBDfilter-survey will be running in the background, it will take
some time to finish the measurement. Need to check the status until you see "done!"
in the output of obdfilter.

2. Introduction to parser.sh
    This LIOProf RPC Parser is used to parse rpc logs collected from OSS nodes,
it can be run as a normal user (non-admin).

[Input]
(1) Input usage information
    Usage: parser.sh [-i] [-x] [-y] [-t]
        -i  path to LIOProf rpc tracing logs
        -x  lowest Lustre Client [IB IP Address]
        -y  highest Lustre Client [IB IP Address]
        -t  Type of Operation Code (OPC) (OST_READ 3, OST_WRITE 4)

(2) Input example
    # parser.sh -i /home/USER_NAME/lioprof_home/job-1468618740/rpc \
    # -x 192.168.1.38 -y 192.168.1.41 -t 3

[Output]
(1) Output location
    Output is stored in the same directory as input rpc log. In the above
example, output locates in /home/USER_NAME/lioprof_home/job-1468618740/rpc-out

(2) Output information
    Count I/O requests per second.
