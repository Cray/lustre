.SH SYNOPSIS
.SY "lctl pool_destroy"
.RB [ -n | --nowait ]
.IR FSNAME . POOLNAME
.YS
.SH DESCRIPTION
Delete an OST pool with the name
.I POOLNAME
in the filesystem named
.IR FSNAME .
The
.B lctl pool_destroy
command must be run on the MGS node and can only be used by the root user.
.SH NOTES
After updating the MGS configuration,
this command tries to wait and check if pools are updated on a client.
If the MGS is on a separate node from the MDS, a Lustre client must
be mounted on the MGS node while the
.B lctl
commands are being run for this. Otherwise, the client check is skipped.
.SH OPTIONS
