.SH NAME
lctl-nodemap_modify \- modify a nodemap property
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B lctl nodemap_modify <--name nodemap_name> <--property property_name>
<--value value>
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nodemap_modify
modifies a property of the given nodemap.

.SH OPTIONS
.I nodemap_name
is the name of the nodemap to modify

.I property_name
is one of the following properties:
.RS 0.3i
.PP
admin
.RS 4
Defaults to off. If set to on, then root will NOT be squashed. By default,
the root user is mapped to the value of squash_uid.
.RE
.PP
trusted
.RS 4
Defaults to off. If set to on, then user mapping will be disabled for all
non-root users. This means that the identities provided by the client will be
trusted to match the identities of the file system. By default, the client user
identities are mapped to the file system identities based on the nodemap rules.
.RE
.PP
squash_uid
.RS 4
Defaults to 99. The user ID that unknown users (if not trusted) and root (if not admin) should be mapped to.
.RE
.PP
squash_gid
.RS 4
Defaults to 99. The group ID that unknown groups (if not trusted) and root (if not admin) should be mapped to.
.RE
.PP
squash_projid
.RS 4
Defaults to 99. The project ID that unknown projects (if not trusted) should be mapped to.
.RE
.PP
deny_unknown
.RS 4
Defaults to off. If set to on then unknown (squashed) users will be denied
access to the filesystem completely instead of just being squashed. Users are
considered unknown by nodemap if the admin flag is off and the user is root, or
trusted are set to off and the user is not mapped.

Note: directory entries cached by a Lustre client may be visible to unknown
users located on the same client, though the contents of the files will not be.
.RE
.PP
audit_mode
.RS 4
Defaults to on, which lets clients record file system access events to the
Changelogs, if Changelogs are otherwise activated. If set to 0, events from
these clients are not logged into the Changelogs, no matter if Changelogs are
activated or not.
The reason not to record file system events from given clients is to prevent
some nodes (e.g. backup, HSM agent nodes) from flooding the Changelogs.
.RE
.PP
map_mode
.RS 4
Defaults to all, which means the nodemap maps UIDs, GIDs, and PROJIDs.
Other possible values (multiple can be specified, comma separated) are uid to
map UIDs, gid to map GIDs, both to map UIDs and GIDs, and projid to map PROJIDs.
.RE
.PP
readonly_mount
.RS 4
Defaults to off, which lets clients mount in read-write mode. If set to 1,
clients are only allowed to mount in read-only mount, and get -EROFS otherwise.
.RE

.RE
.I value
is the value to set for the property. Should be 0 or 1 for admin and trusted.
